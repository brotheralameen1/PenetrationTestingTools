This folder won't really have any penetration testing tools but will contain more of what is with Mr. Slowik. The Rabbit E-Whoring Guide was a guide by D4RKR4BB1T which existed back before he became a Security Researcher. Nonetheless, the point of this folder is to prove rather that it's in Mr. Slowik's archives and taken from his Google Drive, as he has this stuff on R4BB1T from back in the day.
