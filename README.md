# PenetrationTestingTools
Basic Penetration Testing Tools used for Web Application Systems

This repository contains a text document containing access to tools used for penetration testing of web application systems, first given to me by Mr. Michael Oscar Slowik, aka, cathatethical after supposedly working on scraping the source code of BreachForums, which was then leaked online to ExposedVC, later downloaded from the forum and gotten by Pavel Maxim Kravkenko, aka, D4RKR4BB1T. This text document contains the documentations and access to tools that Mr. Slowik uses for his penetration testing, the same tool which was used and tested against the websites of Eric Brogdon by Mr. Slowik himself on his Virtual Machines to scrape Mr. Brogdon's sites before he got Armadyl (Morderator and Janitor of BreachForums, a friend of Mr. Slowik who pretends to be 16 Years Old when he's not) DDoSed them.

This text document contains a variety of tools and built-in linux functionalities that can be used for Penetration Testing without needing to install most of the tools. Nonetheless, for the tools that are needed to be installed, I guess you could just Google them up, if you're not running on a Kali Linux or Parrot Security OS. Anyway, that's that.
