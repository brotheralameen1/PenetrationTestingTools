This program is meant to help you keep up with the status of your HackerOne Report whenever an Analyst updates it. Plenty of ways that work is when a report is sent to HackerOne and that report is sent to your email. This Python Program gives you real-time updates about your report directly from the Python Interpreter by accessing the HackerOne API.

To use this program:

1. Clone this repository
2. Change the required attributes to your own (Report ID to monitor, Your API Key and so on)
3. Save the program
4. Run the program and keep track of your reports in real time

RE: You can replicate the program if you have many reports to check their status at the same time.
