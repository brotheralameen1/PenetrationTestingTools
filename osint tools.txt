I've seen whois and domain web tools shared here but essentially many of these can be accessed directly in basic command line a few clicks away from your environment.

For the one that you don't need to install anything:

nslookup site.com - IP lookup a domain

whois site.com - what the tool does, and you can copy the email

traceroute site.com or tracert 0.0.0.0 - network route tracking

ping 0.0.0.0 - check host availability

wget -S --spider https://sub.site.com - web spider

wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --span-hosts site.com - mirror offline domain/URL/content and related subdomains.

curl -s http://site.com - dump the page content

curl -o https://site.com/robots.txt file.txt - to download and rename files

nc -vzu site.org 8080 - check for open port

nmap -sV â€”script vuln 1.1.1.1

nmap -Pn -sP -A 13.113.196.1/24 - list all the hosts from site.com. Within WLAN this command can also scan and list all users on the same local network as you.

shodan host --history 1.1.1.1 - (.edu gets free acct) list all host history

shodan domain -HD site.com - list domain history and details

shodan scan 13.113.196.1/24 - scan all IPs on site.com

In the case of nmap be aware that you are leaving a pretty clear trace back to your ip address with this type of scan. Depending what hosts you are scanning you could raise some eyebrows.

Download it, use it, but just understand what you are doing and that you are making a lot of noise that can be seen on a network. A great tool for troubleshooting your own network, but others may not be to thrilled if you start scanning theirs.

Read before using. https://linux.die.net/man/1/nmap


You can set nmap -e and specify the interface to a VPN if you are running one.



Edit: Alternatively I believe you can also "spoof" the IP using nmap -S and there is also the --proxies option to run through HTTP/SOCKS5.

You can even spoof the MAC using --spoof-mac.
